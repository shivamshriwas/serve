### Does Torchserve API's  follow some REST API standard?
Torchserve API's are compliant with the [OpenAPI specification 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### What is not Torchserve?
Torchserve is not a complete web application to serve end to end bussiness use cases. Hence alot of security aspects should be made available via 3rd party warapper components in front of Torchserve.

### What's difference between Torchserve and a python webapp using webframework like Flask,Django?
The Flask app and Torchserve are completely different except the fact that both support handling http request however using different engines [netty or python apis].

###  Are there any sample Models available?
There are various models that are provided in Torchserve out of the box. Checkout out Torchserve [Model Zoo](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md) for list of all available models in model zoo. Also checkout examples folder all available [examples](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples).

### Does Torchserve has Windows Support?
Currently Torchserve supports Windows only via WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux).
The native Windows support will be added in upcoming releases.

### Can I do streaming service with Torchserve like streaming speech recognition?
Torchserve currently supports only inference though HTTP 1.0 - Request / Response style.
We dont have anything particular in out roadmap - [pytorch/pytorch#27610](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/27610)

### Is it possible to deploy model other than Pytorch framework?
Yes, it is possible to deploy(with Python inference logic) however Torchserve has been certified with any other framework hence there can be unknowns.

###  Does Torchserve support other models based on programming languages other than python?
No, As of now only python based models are supported.


### What benefits Torchserve has over AWS Multi-Model-server?
Torchserve is derived from Multi-Model-server, But Torchserve is specifically tuned for Pytorch models. It also has new features like Snapshot and model versioning.

## Deployment and config
Relavant documents.
- [Torchserve configuration](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)
- [Model zoo](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md#model-zoo)

### Can I run Torchserve APIs on different ports other than 8080 & 8081?
Yes, Torchserve API ports are configurable using a properties file or enviroment variable.Refer  [configuration.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) for more details.


### How can I resolve model  specific python dependency ?
You can provide a requirements.txt while creating a mar file using "requirements-file/-r"flag. Also you can your dependency files using "--extra-files" flag. Refer  [configuration.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) for more details.


## API
Relavant documents
- [Torchserve Rest API](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md#model-zoo)
###  What can I use other than *curl* to make requests to Torchserve?
You can use any tool like Postman, Insomnia or even use a python script to do so. Find sample python script [here](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/default_handlers.md#torchserve-default-inference-handlers).


## Handler
Relavant documents
- [Default handlers](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md#model-zoo)
- [Custom Handlers](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/custom_service.md#custom-handlers)

###  How do I return an image output for a model ?
You would have write a custom handler with the post processing to return image.
Refer [custom  service documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/custom_service.md#custom-handlers) for more details.

### How to enhance  the default handlers?
Write a custom handler which extends the default handler and just override the methods to be tuned.
Refer  [custom  service documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/custom_service.md#custom-handlers) for more details.

### How to serve a model with no-code/zero code ?
Yes you can deploy your model with no-code/ zero code by using builtin default handlers. Refer [default handlers](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/default_handlers.md#torchserve-default-inference-handlers) for more details.

## Model-archiver

 -[Model-archiver ](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/model-archiver#torch-model-archiver-for-torchserve)

### What is a mar file?
A mar file is nothing but a zip file consisting of all model artifacts with ".mar" extension. The cmd line utility *torch-model-archiver*  is used to create mar file.
